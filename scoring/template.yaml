# into a list of lists. Each entry in the nested lists is a dictionary with the
# following keys:
#  * 'robots': Records the TLAs of the robots which were in the square at the
#              end of the match. This is a list of robot TLAs, any TLA must be
#              one of the teams which is recorded as being in the match.
#  * 'tokens': Records the tokens which were in the square at the end of the
#              match. This is a string of letters each representing a token by
#              its colour. For example, PPO indicates two purple tokens and an
#              orange token.
